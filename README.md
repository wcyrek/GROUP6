To install after you download please copy-pasta the vendor folder into the site folder.  The vendor folder is the same for all laravel projects.  To generate a project locally in order to get the vendor folder do: composer create-project laravel/laravel --prefer-dist <project directory> and then copy the vendor folder from there to GROUP6 directory

In case of errors with vendor folder use "composer update --dry-run" from the project root

COMPOSER UPDATE
======

If you have to update the composer because a message tells you you are using an old build run "composer self-update"
